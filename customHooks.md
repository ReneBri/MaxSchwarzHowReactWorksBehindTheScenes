## What are custom hooks?

Custom hooks are just re-usable functions which contain stateful logic.

Unlike regular functions, custom hooks can use other React hooks and React state.

Custom hooks must always start with 'use'.

For each call of the custom hook new state is created. It is only logic this is re-used each call.
